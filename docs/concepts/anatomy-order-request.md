# Anatomy of An Order Request
## How to structure the JSON payload to create an order

This document will detail the fields and nested fields required in the JSON payload to create an `Order`.

<!-- theme: success -->

> ðŸ’¡ For a quick background on the terminology used in this document, check out [Yojee Terminology](./yojee-terminology.md)

## Single-Leg vs Multi-Leg Orders
In the most simple case, an `Order` will have a single leg, like the following example. A Supplier wants to ship his items to a Customer. In this case, there will be one `Leg` and there will be a `Pickup Task` at the Supplier and a `Dropoff Task` at the Customer.

```mermaid
  graph LR
    S[Supplier] -->|Leg 1| C[Customer]
```

However, in some cases, an `Order` can have more than one leg. Examples of multi-leg `Orders`  include moving containers between factories and the port for export and imports

**Export**
- **Leg 1** Pickup empty container from Container Yard and send to Factory/Warehouse for loading
- **Leg 2** Pickup filled container from Factory/Warehouse and send to Port
```mermaid 
  graph LR
    Y[Container Yard] -->|Leg 1| F1[Factory]
    F2[Factory] -->|Leg 2| P[Port]
```

**Import**
- **Leg 1** Pickup container from Port and send to Warehouse/Customer location
- **Leg 2** Pickup empty container from Warehouse/Customer and return to Container Yard
```mermaid 
  graph LR
    P[Port] -->|Leg 1| W1[Warehouse]
    W2[Warehouse] -->|Leg 2| Y[Container Yard]
```

      required:

        - type
```

### First Level parameters
Parameters to provide more information in the `Orders`. These parameters are all non-mandatory:
- **external_id** Every `Order` will be assigned a Yojee `Order Number`(sometimes referred to as `Order ID`) that looks like `O-4W4TUNATPG9S`. To identify the order using your own order id, enter the value of your order id in this field.
- **price_currency**
- **price_amount**
- **container_no** Used to track the container no for this order. 
- **Parameters for Sender** see next section

#### Parameters for Sender
![Dispatcher Portal - Sender](../../assets/images/concepts/sender-n-external-id.png)

The following parameters relate to telling Yojee who is the `Sender` for this order. These parameters are all non-mandatory:
- **sender_id** After creating a `Sender` in the `Dispatcher Portal` (see above screenshot), you will see a numeric Sender ID in the table listing the `Senders`. Use this numeric ID to indicate that the `Order` is sent by this `Sender`. When both this field and the **external_sender_id** fields are present in the payload, this field takes precedence.
- **external_sender_id** When creating a `Sender` in the `Dispatcher Portal`, there is an option to assign an External ID to the `Sender`. Use this External ID in this field to indicate that the `Order` is sent by this `Sender`. 
- **sender_type** Either `organisation` or `individual`. Use `organisation` for integration purposes.
- **placed_by_user_profile_id** This field indicates the `User` in Yojee system that created this order.

### Nested parameters
The Create Order payload includes the following nested parameters that are **required**:
- **items** information for the `Items` in the `Order`
- **steps** information on location and time requirements for the respective `Task`
- **item_steps** linking the `Items` to the `Steps`

#### Items
An array of `Items` in the `Order` that needs to be moved.

#### Steps
An array of `Steps` that contains
- **address information** Address-related fields to indicate where this `Step` needs to take place. There are also the `lat` and `lng` fields to allow you to input the exact geo-coordinates of the location.
- **contact information** Contact information of the person at the location. Email address and phone information may be used for notifications through SMS or Email.
- **time slots** `from_time` and `to_time` to indicate the time slot within which the `Task` at this `Step` needs to be completed.

#### Item Steps
An array of JSON objects linking up the `Items` and `Steps` defined above.

Each `Item` will be implicitly assigned an `item_id`, starting with 0 for the first item and incrementing by 1.

Each `Step` will also be implicityly assigned an `order_step_id`, starting with 0 for the first step and incrementing by 1.

The values in `ItemStep` will then link them up with a JSON like the following:
```json
    {
      "item_id": 0,
      "order_step_id": 0,
      "type": "pickup"
    },
    {
      "item_id": 0,
      "order_step_id": 1,
      "type": "dropoff"
    }
```

This means, the first `Item` has a `Pickup Task` at the location indicated at the first `Step`, and there is also a `Dropoff Task` at the location indicated at the second `Step`.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> Note that for more than one `Item`, there will need to be more than one pair of `ItemSteps` defined.

### Sample Payload

```json

  "item_steps": [
    {

The payload above has two `Items` - 4 Laptop computers and 1 Printer to be picked up at 20 Pasir Panjang Road and dropped off at 1 Changi Business Park. Note that there are 4 `ItemSteps`.
